0.4.0    
    
    * Experiments with smooth scrolling.
    * Outline view.
    * Fixed couple of bugs with text search.
    * Changed found text visualization.
    * Found text is centered now.
    * Drag zoom has been merged back.
    * Navigating using tap zones. There are 9 tap zones forming 3x3 matrix,
      each can be assigned for an independent function. Taps distinguished
      by relative absence of movement and short holding time so they
      do not invalidate screen dragging.
      Zones called:
          UL UC UR
          ML MC MR
          BL BC BR
      with obvius meaning.
    * Reduced number of screen updates.
    * Avoid page rendering after Options dialog.
    * Handle screen and window resizing.
    * Scrollbar scrolling uses larger steps.
    * up/down and left/right screen by screen scrolling, assigned to
      tap zones UC/BC and ML/MR.
    * Unique 'native' scrolling, assigned to BL/BR. BR causes current view
      rotating in X axis, without changing Y axis at all just like
      a reader do: scroll screen by screen to the left, and jump to
      beginning of column when end of column reached. BL causes Y view
      movements row by row.
      This scrolling can be configured to support one or two column mode.
      The scrolling uses 'black box' - i.e. the page area which is detected
      to contain something during painting operation.
    * Xpdf has been modified a bit to produce 'black box' instead of
      'modified box'.
    * Text search is implemented. Needs better indication though.
    * Image properties dialog is implemented allowing to change
      DPI.

    * New: Flip page when scrolling below bottom or above top (using keys or 
      buttons, not the scrollbar)
    * New: CAB file for installation
    * Fix: PDFFile association now also works for mail attachments (MSMessaging)
    * Fix: Disabling the file association in the Options-Dialog restores the 
      associations installed by Adobe Reader(TM)/ClearVuePDF(TM)
